### Overview
Kitten VR began as an experiment with building low poly environments in Unity 5, and quickly turned into a simple application with a lot of potential. My goals with Kitten VR are twofold: to have a simple, easy to play mini-game for use with virtual reality devices that I can use as a basis for testing new VR SDKs, and to document the process for those interested in learning how to build applications that take advantage of today's VR ecosystem themselves.

Update: 12/21/15
The latest version of KittenVR (0.2.0) is now available for download at [KittenVR.com](http://kittenvr.com). This is built for the Oculus 0.8 runtime.
